2023-01-01 05:50:00,"Chief of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine Major General Kyrylo Budanov: Russians have enough missile stocks for two or three more massive attacks on Ukraine  - Under very favorable conditions, Russians can produce up to 50 X-101 and Kalibr missiles per month. That is, for one missile attack on Ukraine, Russians need to work for one and a half to two months, - Kyrylo Budanov said.  Also, the engine resource of Russian aircrafts is being exhausted.  - Strategic bombers-missile carriers have to cover quite a long distance to launch missiles. Now Russian bombers do not approach the usual areas of attack: they take off, make a circle or two in the sky and launch missiles practically over the airfield to reduce the aircraft&#39;s engine life.  According to him, Russia currently has about 70 bombers: Tu-160 and Tu-95. They have about 70-80 units of Tu-22M. About 40% of them are faulty.  https://t.me/operativnoZSU ",1
