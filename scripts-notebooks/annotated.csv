513,575,"  Dear friends, we remind you that from today all Ukrainians can get energy-saving LED lamps for free  Old incandescent lamps should be replaced.    How many bulbs can you get?  According to the website of the department, a total of 5 old lamps can be exchanged for 5 new ones.    Only Ukrainians over 18 years old can do this.     Why is it useful for the country?  They explain that it is a significant saving. After all, new LED lamps can save the country up to 1.5 gigawatts of electricity during peak hours.    How to exchange light bulbs?  A person who decides to use the program needs to    ▫️ previously leave an application in the public services application ""Diia"",  ▫️ come to the Ukrposhta branch,  ▫️ exchange five old-style lamps for the same number of LED lamps.

539,600,"  🐧 Indian scientists have discovered that some species of wild penguins may have a certain degree of self-awareness.    The researchers conducted four experiments. In the first, they simply put some mirrors on the ground near the penguins and watched as random penguins looked into them. The second involved building a cardboard pen around the penguins, which directed them to the mirrors. During the third, scientists placed small stickers in the shape of penguins on the mirrors. And during the last test, the researchers put bibs on the penguins and put them in front of the mirror.    Scientists did not find the answer in the first experiment, which was actually a discovery many animals do not pass such a test when they believe that the creature they see in the mirror is something else, and react accordingly. In the second experiment, the penguins moved in a way that suggested they were exploring themselves.    The penguins were also worried looking at the mirrors with stickers and actively tried to remove them. But they did not react at all to the fact that they were wearing a small bib.    @babel ",0

The group's analysts believe that the warhead was modified in a hurry - layers with dozens of small fragments that fly a long distance during impact are poorly matched to each other.     In addition, there are 18 smaller ""charges"" around the warhead, which, after detonation, fly 360 degrees and can pierce armor.    💬 ""It's as if they looked at the finished warhead and said ""How can we make it even more destructive?"", said Damien Splitters, one of the researchers.    According to him, warheads designed to engage combat targets such as tanks or artillery systems are usually designed differently and contain a forward-looking, high explosive charge. However, the warhead studied by CAR provides for a radial cumulative effect to increase the area of damage.    🇺🇦Реальная War ",0

1544,1680,"  Whether we like it or not, yes, military assistance will continue to depend on the fight against systemic corruption.     Yes, this problem is hyperbolized by our allies. Yes, it is unfair to make our survival dependent on political manipulations.    Yes, this is largely due to the elections of our allies, which is a flaw in democracy.    Whether you like it or not, it is so. And our enemy is betting on this. On long-term work to undermine confidence in us.     But this does not mean that we have to wring our hands and say how unappreciated we are.    Let's face it - we do have corruption. It is systemic corruption.    And it needs to be destroyed. We need to fire corrupt officials from the police, punish them, and not give them a general, like Shaikhetu did yesterday.    There are so many examples that 10 posts would not be enough.     And no, launching weapons production at home will not save us. It will help, but it will not save us. Because this is too big a war and we cannot bear the financial burden alone. And we will not have the necessary capacities for such a big war.     It is time to change. And only one person can really start these changes - the president.    And he should start with a part of his own environment. ",0

2755,85,"  📰 What the world wrote about the Russian-Ukrainian war on July 21  🖌 An article in The Wall Street Journal discusses the motivation of the Russians to withdraw from the grain deal. If we analyze the market data, the logic of the aggressor country becomes obvious without worsening the terms of trade for Ukraine, the Russians would have been left without profit, the newspaper writes. Grain prices, which skyrocketed with the start of Russia's full-scale attack on Ukraine and peaked last summer, have returned to their previous levels in recent weeks. Russian farmers have begun asking the state for subsidies, as business has become unprofitable for them. Ukraine, on the other hand, is still among the world's largest exporters of a number of grains and oilseeds and is a direct competitor to the Russians.    No claims of ""retaliation for the damage to the Crimean bridge"" from the Russians are convincing now, they have no basis in reality, the WSJ article says. Putin's government simply needed to raise world prices, and it did so by withdrawing from the agreement and trying to destroy Ukrainian port facilities. The promise to treat any ship sailing to a Ukrainian port as a military target effectively makes it impossible to export goods through them.    Ukraine anticipated this scenario and worked out ways to export grain by land and the Danube River in recent months, two-thirds of exports have gone through these routes. Ukrainian diplomats are also now trying to convince Asian and African countries to put pressure on the Russians to restore the corridor. After all, they are the ones who are primarily suffering from the price increases provoked by the Russians, the publication writes.    @babel #inozmi ",0

2760,142,"  ❓ What is a keylogger program? What harm can it do to the device?  ℹ️ The State Service of Special Communications provides answers to the most frequently asked questions of Ukrainians about countering threats in cyberspace, safe use of phones, the Internet, etc.    A keylogger is software that records various actions of a device user. For example, it records the movement of a computer mouse, keystrokes, screenshots, etc. Thus, it is a kind of ""spyware"".    Keyloggers can be used both authorized and for malicious purposes. In the latter case, hackers can use keyloggers to take possession of user data that was entered after the program was installed. In particular, they can gain access to logins and passwords, card numbers, and other important data.    Keyloggers can be either a standalone program or part of another piece of software. For example, one of the well-known programs - Agent Tesla, which was previously reported by the Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA - can act as a keylogger, information stealer and is a remote access trojan.    ❗ Note also that a keylogger can be not only a program but also a hardware device that is installed if there is physical access to the desired computer.    📢 Just a reminder. To protect your computer from malware    ◾ download programs only from official stores or developer websites,  ◾ do not open suspicious links and attachments sent by e-mail, messengers, social networks, etc. from unknown senders,  ◾ use and update antiviruses and software in a timely manner and follow other cyber hygiene rules.

They learned that the NCSSM at the request of Ukrnafta clearly noted that the replacement of members of the supervisory board of Ukrnafta, elected as representatives of the shareholder, is possible only if Ukrnafta has the rights and obligations of the shareholder.

""These rules are actually suitable for all frontline regions of Ukraine, and not only. Therefore, we consider it appropriate to publish them     Try not to stay in the streets during air raids. Ballistic missiles arrive in about 5-10 minutes, depending on the place of launch, cruise missiles take longer. The air force always warns about the threat.     Yes, there are not shelters everywhere. Yes, this is a problem. But there are concrete protective structures on the streets, parking lots, and the two-wall rule. When the alarm goes off, if possible, do not stay on the streets.     Skeptics may say that these are obvious things. However, sometimes human carelessness is surprising, to say the least. When, for example, people with children walk in parks and squares during anxiety, it's beyond belief.

No. Their goal is terror. The horde wants to destroy us physically and morally. There is a war going on, so there is no safe place in the country.

Kovalenko, coordinator of the Information Resistance group and military expert, said that in the event of total mobilization, the country's economy would come to a standstill.    There is also a problem with the staffing of the unit. If 1 million soldiers are sent to the Armed Forces from the rear, 1,250 battalion tactical groups will need to be manned. This means 13,750 tanks, 41,250 armored combat vehicles, millions of assault rifles with ammunition, and equipment.    ""The question is, who will provide so many weapons?

2829,769,"  📰The US needs Crimea as a means of putting pressure on Russia. What the world's leading media wrote about the war in Ukraine  🖌The Hill explains why Washington is avoiding a definitive answer to the question of whether the United States will help Ukraine regain Crimea. Despite the fact that the world formally recognizes that the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 is the territory of Ukraine, neither the White House nor the Pentagon has been clear in the full-scale war that has been going on for over a year about whether they will support Ukraine with weapons to destroy the Russian contingent there or, on the contrary, prohibit Kyiv from moving in this direction. Until the fall, discussions about Crimea were conducted ""from a safe distance,"" writes journalist Ellen Mitchell it seemed that the power of the Russian army would not allow the Ukrainian army to return the territory. However, the successful fall counteroffensive operations and the growing problems of the Russian army and the Kremlin in general have made the prospects of the operation real and the talk of returning Crimea relevant. A significant number of American officials are still skeptical that Ukraine will be able to go beyond Perekop, while others fear Putin's likely unpredictable reaction. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, the Americans decided to ""dangle"" the Crimean issue to give Putin some ground for a possible compromise. As soon as he realizes that he may lose one of his main ""achievements"" during his rule in Russia, his rhetoric will change - and then it may be possible to reach an agreement with the tyrant on terms acceptable to Kyiv, Washington expects. Therefore, so far, the dictator has not been pushed into a dead end with statements about the return of Crimea, and when Ukrainians ask, American officials say that the Ukrainian armed forces have yet to liberate large areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, so it is too early to talk about the peninsula.    🖌For more information on the role of cryptocurrencies in Russia's war with Ukraine, follow the link.    @babel #inozmi ",0

2837,842,"  My sincere condolences to the director of the Chernihiv Regional Youth Center, Iryna Simonova, on the irreparable loss of her son, Andriy Yurchenko, who was heroically killed. The defender is forever 21.  Today Chernihiv will say goodbye to a young and extremely brave officer. You will be able to pay your last respects to the Hero at 1400 near St. Catherine's Church.    The young man successfully graduated from Chernihiv Collegium #11 and the regional lyceum of enhanced military and physical training. Since the age of 6, he has been practicing judo. In 2019, he entered the National Army Academy named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi.   In February-March 2022, he defended Kyiv.    In 2023, he received a bachelor's degree from the Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Army Academy and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.    Lieutenant Andrii Yurchenko was selected as one of the best in the consolidated artillery unit and sent to the Royal School of Artillery of the United Kingdom.    The command entrusted the young officer with the position of commander of a self-propelled artillery battery. And on May 1, 2023, his unit received its baptism of fire in the battles for the fortress city of Bakhmut.    For almost a month, the self-propelled artillery battery under the command of Lieutenant Yurchenko took part in the battles. For successful completion of combat missions and courage, he was nominated for the Silver Cross award.    The young battery commander also fought for settlements Orikhiv, Robotyne, and Verbove.    On August 30, 2023, during the reconnaissance of the area to determine the location of firing positions, the group, which included Lieutenant Yurchenko, was fired upon by enemy artillery. As a result of a direct hit to the car, the young commander's heart stopped. ",0

The New York Times reports this with reference to a senior U.S. Department of Defense procurement official.    This step will be taken to compensate for the shortage caused by the war in Ukraine and to create reserves for future conflicts.

2853,1030,"  Since the beginning of 2023, Ukrainian bomber drones have destroyed thousands of pieces of Russian equipment worth billions of dollars. Oleksiy Honcharuk, chairman of the supervisory board of Aerorazvedka, explains how this innovative weapon is changing the tactics of the Armed Forces.    🚀 Technological competitions in the sky  During the full-scale war, Ukrainians have created many completely new types of weapons, as well as rethought the use of already known ones. In particular, we are talking about a new type of bomber drone called Baba Yaga. Having appeared back in 2014, these drones have evolved rapidly. Over the past year, their number has increased significantly, which has had a significant impact on enemy tactics.    🌟 Victory of innovation  Bomber drones have already proved their effectiveness by destroying thousands of pieces of equipment for billions of dollars, while the cost of their creation remains in the millions. For 1 UAH spent on the creation of a bomber drone, it is possible to inflict approximately 100 times more damage on the enemy.    💡 High-quality scaling  Increasing the number of drones at the front is not enough to win. Scaling must be qualitative, and this is only possible if the strategies for their use are changed. To ensure the effectiveness of the use of drones, a high-quality state policy and coordinated work of military structures are needed.     💪 The path to victory  The development and improvement of technology are key tasks to ensure victory. From introducing synchronization matrices to improve coordination between units and deepening the use of the Delta system to improve situational awareness to providing crews with quality ammunition. This is a lot of work that the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the General Staff need to do in the coming months.    ➡️ Read the full text here https//cutt.ly/2wE5sqrL ",0

2909,1509,"  This is not a day of tulips.    The holiday was introduced on March 8, 1910, by German communist Clara Zetkin at the Socialist International conference in Copenhagen to demand that women be able to hold rallies and demonstrations to draw public attention to their issues.     In the USSR, March 8 became an official holiday in 1921, and an official day off was introduced in 1965. That's when the transformation of the holiday that we see today took place.    We should not think that the communists provided women with rights. On the contrary, they deprived women of these rights.    March 8 is recognized as a national holiday in most countries that were part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union desecrated this day and turned it into a ""holiday of femininity, flowers, spring"" and a day off.     A day that keeps Ukraine in the Soviet past. Looking through the prism of the Soviet system, this day is definitely not about women's rights. It is a day when we need not a day off, but an understanding that this is not a ""flower festival"".     It's high time to reject the dogmas imposed by the Soviet system.     @strichka_ua - stay up to date  #Day_in_history ",0

It should be focused not on raw materials, as it used to be, but on all groups of goods. Especially on products with high added value.     - Focus on reducing imports to Ukraine and developing domestic industry. There are opportunities for the development of domestic production in Ukraine, and they are virtually unlimited. With affordable financing, almost anything can be produced.    - Special support for Ukrainian entrepreneurs. The development of domestic production requires minimum loan rates and government guarantees.     - Risk insurance for foreign investors. Foreign investors need transparent conditions and new forms of risk-based asset insurance.    - A level playing field for business. The existence of companies operating in the ""black"" or ""gray"" distorts fair competition, making the work of companies operating exclusively in the legal field less efficient.    - Eliminate smuggling and clandestine production. We need to understand that smuggling takes away the future of Ukrainian producers. It deprives them of prospects in their own market.     - Economic patriotism. Ukrainian goods must become truly the best.    - Fight against corruption. The law should apply equally to everyone. If someone has ""additional opportunities,"" the whole business feels it. And everyone wants to have these ""opportunities"". That's how corruption feeds. Business feeds it.

2995,2366,"  The story of the offices of phone scammers has turned bright colors  First of all, these offices are being torn down by pro-Russian MP Dmytruk, MP Kunitsky, who has been invisible throughout the war, and the odious MP Kolya Tishchenko.

The story is very scandalous from all sides. And given that rumors have surfaced that Kolya may be roofing one particular four-storey call center, it's very vivid in general.    We'll be watching to see how this movement develops.    And once again, I would like to appeal to the law enforcement agencies Please remove the shady MPs from this case, they are discrediting it.
