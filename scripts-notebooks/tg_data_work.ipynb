недоїдання, особливо на окупованих і деокупованих територіях україни. побачивши змучених та дуже худих тварин виникає бажання якнайшвидше їх нагодувати, проте це потрібно робити з великою обережністю, щоб не нашкодити.  команда «єдиної планети» разом із євгенією максименко, лікаркою-терапевткою ветеринарної клініки «а-вет» підготували поради про те, як діяти, якщо зустріли виснажену тварину:  ✅ виснажену собаку, за можливості, краще якнайшвидше показати ветеринару. ❌ важливо не перегодовувати собаку, що тривалий час не їла. перший час годування має відбуватися що 3–4 години невеличкими порціями. в іншому разі травна система може не впоратися, є ризик летальних наслідків. ✅ годувати потрібно їжею з високим вмістом білка й низьким містом вуглеводів, водночас їжа повинна містити мінерали, як-от: калій, магній і фосфор. ✅ на перший час (до 5 днів) краще годувати тварину консервами або натуральною м’якою їжею (відварне м’ясо, каші, овочі). ❌ заборонено давати виснаженій тварині жирну, тяжку для перетравлення їжу, кістки, не бажано давати молочні й кисломолочні продукти. ✅ потрібно стежити за кількістю випитої води – на 1 кг маси має бути 50 мл і більше води. за необхідності можна поїти примусово.  пам’ятаймо про тварин, вони зараз дуже потребують нашого захисту та підтримки❤️  джерело: the village source : https://t.me/evacuationukraine/2373 будь у безпеці!

ми маємо зберегти максимальну єдність – єдність усіх людей світу, які цінують мир, поважають право на життя для кожного й достатньо чесні, щоб визнати: постійний терор проти цивільного населення є очевидною відмовою росії від справжніх переговорів.  ➡️ тому потрібне офіційне визнання росії державою-терористом – визнання на всіх рівнях.  ➡️ потрібне обмеження будь-яких економічних контактів з будь-якими російськими суб’єктами – не можна бути спонсорами тероризму.  ➡️ потрібне чітке засудження на всіх рівнях кожного ескалаційного кроку росії – від терористичних ударів до злочинної спроби анексії нашої території. відповідна резолюція днями розглядатиметься генеральною асамблеєю оон. ми побачимо по голосуванню, хто і як ставиться до терористів насправді.  ➡️ і потрібна принципова й достатня допомога україні. допомога нашим людям, які є мішенню для держави-терориста. треба пришвидшити надання україні достатньої кількості ефективних систем протиповітряної оборони. саме переговори про надання таких систем ппо, саме переговори про збільшення іншої оборонної, політичної та фінансової підтримки україни – це і є той єдиний можливий переговорний формат, який може реально наблизити мир.  ➡️ я дякую всім, хто допомагає нам протистояти терору! дякую всім, хто воює й працює заради повернення україні миру і кожному українцю – гарантій права на життя й безпеку.  ➡️ вічна памʼять усім

🐶 how to feed and care for dogs that have been starving for a long time?  because of the war, many dogs suffer from malnutrition, especially in the occupied and de-occupied territories of ukraine. seeing exhausted and very thin animals, there is a desire to feed them as soon as possible, but this must be done with great care so as not to harm them.  the team of \"one planet\" together with yevheniia maksymenko, a doctor-therapist of the veterinary clinic \"a-vet\", prepared tips on how to act if you meet an emaciated animal:  ✅ it is better to show an exhausted dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible. ❌ it is important not to overfeed a dog that has not eaten for a long time. the first feeding should take place every 3-4 hours in small portions. otherwise, the digestive system may not cope, there is a risk of fatal consequences. ✅ food should be high in protein and low in carbohydrates, while the food should contain minerals such as potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. ✅ for the first time (up to 5 days) it is better to feed the animal canned food or natural soft food (boiled meat, cereals, vegetables). ❌ it is forbidden to give an exhausted animal fatty, difficult to digest food, bones, it is not advisable to give dairy and dairy products. ✅ it is necessary to monitor the amount of water drunk - there should be 50 ml or more of water per 1 kg of weight. if necessary, you can force feed.  let's remember about animals, they now really need our protection and support❤️.  source: the village original : 🐶 як годувати та доглядати за собаками, що довго голодували?  через війну дуже багато собак страждають від недоїдання, особливо на окупованих і деокупованих територіях україни. побачивши змучених та дуже худих тварин виникає бажання якнайшвидше їх нагодувати, проте це потрібно робити з великою обережністю, щоб не нашкодити.  команда «єдиної планети» разом із євгенією максименко, лікаркою-терапевткою ветеринарної клініки «а-вет» підготували поради про те, як діяти, якщо зустріли виснажену тварину:  ✅ виснажену собаку, за можливості, краще якнайшвидше показати ветеринару. ❌ важливо не перегодовувати собаку, що тривалий час не їла. перший час годування має відбуватися що 3–4 години невеличкими порціями. в іншому разі травна система може не впоратися, є ризик летальних наслідків. ✅ годувати потрібно їжею з високим вмістом білка й низьким містом вуглеводів, водночас їжа повинна містити мінерали, як-от: калій, магній і фосфор. ✅ на перший час (до 5 днів) краще годувати тварину консервами або натуральною м’якою їжею (відварне м’ясо, каші, овочі). ❌ заборонено давати виснаженій тварині жирну, тяжку для перетравлення їжу, кістки, не бажано давати молочні й кисломолочні продукти. ✅ потрібно стежити за кількістю випитої води – на 1 кг маси має бути 50 мл і більше води. за необхідності можна поїти примусово.  пам’ятаймо про тварин, вони зараз дуже потребують нашого захисту та підтримки❤️  джерело: the village source :

відповідна резолюція днями розглядатиметься генеральною асамблеєю оон. ми побачимо по голосуванню, хто і як ставиться до терористів насправді.  ➡️ і потрібна принципова й достатня допомога україні. допомога нашим людям, які є мішенню для держави-терориста. треба пришвидшити надання україні достатньої кількості ефективних систем протиповітряної оборони. саме переговори про надання таких систем ппо, саме переговори про збільшення іншої оборонної, політичної та фінансової підтримки україни – це і є той єдиний можливий переговорний формат, який може реально наблизити мир.  ➡️ я дякую всім, хто допомагає нам протистояти терору! дякую всім, хто воює й працює заради повернення україні миру і кожному українцю – гарантій права на життя й безпеку.  ➡️ вічна памʼять усім жертвам російського терору! слава україні!  🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 source : https://t.me/op_ua/7801 офіс президента    \n","44

russian aggression - can and must be stopped only with adequate weapons. the terrorist state will not understand anything else.  weapons on the battlefield. weapons that protect our skies. new sanctions against russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. and legal weapons: we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of russian aggression against ukraine and to compensate for all the damage caused by this war at the expense of russian assets.  every russian missile fired against our cities, every iranian drone used by terrorists is an argument why we need

of \"one planet\" together with yevheniia maksymenko, a doctor-therapist of the veterinary clinic \"a-vet\", prepared tips on how to act if you meet an emaciated animal:   it is better to show an exhausted dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible.  it is important not to overfeed a dog that has not eaten for a long time. the first feeding should take place every 3-4 hours in small portions. otherwise, the digestive system may not cope, there is a risk of fatal consequences.  food should be high in protein and low in carbohydrates, while the food should contain minerals such as potassium, magnesium and phosphorus.  for the first time (up to 5 days) it is better to feed the animal canned food or natural soft food (boiled meat, cereals, vegetables).  it is forbidden to give an exhausted animal fatty, difficult to digest food, bones, it is not advisable to give dairy and dairy products.  it is necessary to monitor the amount of water drunk - there should be 50 ml or more of water per 1 kg of weight. if necessary, you can force feed.  let's remember about animals, they now really need our protection and support.  source: the village   \n","17

recognition at all levels.  we need to restrict any economic contacts with any russian entities - we cannot be sponsors of terrorism.  we need a clear condemnation at all levels of every escalatory step of russia - from terrorist strikes to the criminal attempt to annex our territory. the relevant resolution will be considered by the un general assembly in the coming days. we will see by voting who and how treats terrorists in reality.   and we need principled and sufficient assistance to ukraine. help to our people who are targeted by the terrorist state. it is necessary to accelerate the
