Prices are likely to remain at the current level for the next six months. However, the situation will be influenced by the news from the front. This was told by the President of the Association of Realtors of Ukraine Yuriy Pita. According to him, there is a demand for apartments in the capital, but many people are still in no hurry to buy real estate, as the risks due to the war still remain. ""We will rely on the trends of the last few months - November-December - because the market has basically stabilized. There are no significant shifts in the direction of increase or decrease in value. In 2022, prices fell by about 15-20%, this is since the beginning of the war. They are not continuing their fall, so prices will be at this level. They have fallen to a certain level and will remain so. But, again, much will depend on the situation in the country as a whole,"" the expert explained. Pita added: if there are successes on the front, then the real estate market will also react quite actively. In addition, compensation to Ukrainians who lost their homes will have a positive impact on the situation. ""We hope that housing compensation programs will be launched for those who have lost their homes. This will also affect the market. There will be, perhaps, some monetary compensation or square meters. And the apartments on the market will be searched for somewhere, bought, transferred to those who suffered. So, such trends will be at least six months, and then we will see what will happen next. That is, no significant changes in prices are not expected,"" - the expert concluded. send news @novosti_kieva_bot 👉SUBSCRIBE",0.126,0.786,0.087,-0.9456,Kyiv,Kyiv
