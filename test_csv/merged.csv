Heavy fighting is taking place on the borderline Svatove-Kreminna and in the direction of Lysychansk. The most difficult situation remains in the area of Soledar-Bakhmut-Mayorsk. There the enemy is actually trying to advance over their dead bodies, but the units of the Defense Forces are holding back the enemy offensive at the cost of extraordinary efforts. In the Donetsk sector we managed to hold positions around Avdiivka and continue counter-offensive actions. We are reliably holding the defensive lines in the Zaporizhzhia sector and are making efforts to protect Kherson, first of all civilians and critical infrastructure of the city, from enemy shelling. The situation on the border with the Republic of Belarus is fully controlled. From December 31 to this morning, the enemy launched 14 cruise missile strikes and used 94 Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. I expressed gratitude to General Milley for the foreign-made anti-aircraft missile systems provided with his active assistance. Today, they save lives of civilians of Ukraine. We have also discussed the needs of the Defense Forces to continue the struggle against the aggressor.

As a result, in 2028, only those Ukrainians who have at least 35 years of experience will be able to receive payments on time. Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: ‚ñ™Ô∏èTo do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension. The Pension Fund also told how to check the seniority: In your personal account on the left, select the section ""My insurance record"", where you can view information about your insurance record and paid contributions. For retirement at the age of 60: ‚ñ´Ô∏è in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; ‚ñ´Ô∏è in 2028 - from 35 years old. If you have not met this requirement, there is a chance to retire at the age of 63. To do this, you need to earn at least (depending on when you turn 63) by your 63rd birthday: ‚ñ´Ô∏èin 2022 - from 19 to 29 years; 2023 - from 20 to 30 years; In 2024 - from 21 to 31 years old; In 2025 - from 22 to 32 years old; In 2026 - from 23 to 33 years old; ‚ñ´Ô∏èin 2027 - from 24 to 34 years old.

In the first, they simply put some mirrors on the ground near the penguins and watched as random penguins looked into them. The second involved building a cardboard pen around the penguins, which directed them to the mirrors. During the third, scientists placed small stickers in the shape of penguins on the mirrors. And during the last test, the researchers put bibs on the penguins and put them in front of the mirror. Scientists did not find the answer in the first experiment, which was actually a discovery: many animals do not pass such a test when they believe that the creature they see in the mirror is something else, and react accordingly. In the second experiment, the penguins moved in a way that suggested they were exploring themselves. The penguins were also worried looking at the mirrors with stickers and actively tried to remove them.

As a result, in 2028, only those Ukrainians who have at least 35 years of experience will be able to receive payments on time. Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: ‚ñ™Ô∏èTo do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension. The Pension Fund also told how to check the seniority: In your personal account on the left, select the section ""My insurance record"", where you can view information about your insurance record and paid contributions. For retirement at the age of 60: ‚ñ´Ô∏è in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; ‚ñ´Ô∏è in 2028 - from 35 years old. If you have not met this requirement, there is a chance to retire at the age of 63. To do this, you need to earn at least (depending on when you turn 63) by your 63rd birthday: ‚ñ´Ô∏èin 2022 - from 19 to 29 years; 2023 - from 20 to 30 years; In 2024 - from 21 to 31 years old; In 2025 - from 22 to 32 years old; In 2026 - from 23 to 33 years old; ‚ñ´Ô∏èin 2027 - from 24 to 34 years old. And starting next year, you must have at least 30 years of experience. Those who do not have enough experience will have to work until the age of 63 (if they have 23 years of experience) and 65 (if they have 15 to 23 years of experience).

Most likely they came to Ukraine with the help of a 3rd country, which bought them for us. 2) Domestic projectiles from UOP (3-5 media). The shell index (OF-25T) differs from the classic Soviet OF-25 shell, presumably because of a different manufacturing process-the shells are assembled from several milled parts. The explosive material is also different, using less powerful TNT instead of A-IX-2. Ukroboronprom has also been able to establish the production of new propellant charges - in some pictures, in addition to the usual Soviet markings, one can see the new one, dated 2022.",0.017,0.939,0.043,0.4779,,
