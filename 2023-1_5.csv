He told about the changes in the operational and strategic situation, first of all in the ground and airspace of Ukraine. Heavy fighting is taking place on the borderline Svatove-Kreminna and in the direction of Lysychansk. The most difficult situation remains in the area of Soledar-Bakhmut-Mayorsk. There the enemy is actually trying to advance over their dead bodies, but the units of the Defense Forces are holding back the enemy offensive at the cost of extraordinary efforts. In the Donetsk sector we managed to hold positions around Avdiivka and continue counter-offensive actions. We are reliably holding the defensive lines in the Zaporizhzhia sector and are making efforts to protect Kherson, first of all civilians and critical infrastructure of the city, from enemy shelling. The situation on the border with the Republic of Belarus is fully controlled. From December 31 to this morning, the enemy launched 14 cruise missile strikes and used 94 Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. I expressed gratitude to General Milley for the foreign-made anti-aircraft missile systems provided with his active assistance. Today, they save lives of civilians of Ukraine. We have also discussed the needs of the Defense Forces to continue the struggle against the aggressor. I highly appreciate the leadership of General Milley in providing military assistance to Ukraine.
