# Map Site

This folder contains the code for the Map Site front end. There are the standard 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' files. You will need to run 'npm install' to install node modules locally. The main file here is server.js which implements the node app that runs the front-end of the CombatMessagesUA map. There is also a sub-folder, 'app'.

## App

This subfolder contains two files. 'cmua.png' is the CombatMessagesUA logo image with a transparent background. 'map-site.html' contains the html for the website itself. Currently, the JavaScript for pulling messages from the MongoDB database is included in 'map-site.html' as well as a script.
