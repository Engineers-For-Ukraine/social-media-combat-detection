If you have enough years of service, you can count on your pension.  The Pension Fund also told you how to check your length of service:  In your personal account, select the section &#34;My insurance record&#34; on the left, where you can view information about your insurance record and contributions paid.  To retire at age 60: \u25ab\ufe0f in 2023 - from age 30; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2024 - from age 31; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2025 - 32 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2026 - 33 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2027 - 34 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2028 - 35 years old.  If you do not meet this requirement, there is a chance of retiring at age 63.  You have to earn at least that by your 63rd birthday (depending on when you turn 63):  \u25ab\ufe0f in 2022 - 19 to 29; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2023 - 20 to 30 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2024 - 21 to 31 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2025 - 22 to 32 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2026 - 23 to 33 years old; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2027 - 24 to 34.  And as of next year, you have to have at least 30 years of experience.  Those who do not have enough experience will have to work until they are 63 years old (if they have from 23 years of experience) and 65 years old (if they have from 15 to 23 years of experience).  The second piece of news is that there will be no traditional increase in the minimum pension by the inflation rate this year.
