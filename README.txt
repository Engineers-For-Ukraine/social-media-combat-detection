This project is an attempt to perform sentiment analysis on Ukrainian telegram messages.

Messages are from the archive done by osintukraine.

As of Mar 7, 2023 I have a complete single-day prototype for the url -> html -> csv -> visualization pipeline.

From here, I intend to scale up to week, then month, then finally, complete data and 
build out more informative visualizations.

It's worth looking into what it would look like to host the result as a web app but 
that is far in the future.
