As a result, in 2028, only those Ukrainians who have at least 35 years of experience will be able to receive payments on time. Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: ▪️To do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension. The Pension Fund also told how to check the seniority: In your personal account on the left, select the section ""My insurance record"", where you can view information about your insurance record and paid contributions. For retirement at the age of 60: ▫️ in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; ▫️ in 2028 - from 35 years old. If you have not met this requirement, there is a chance to retire at the age of 63. To do this, you need to earn at least (depending on when you turn 63) by your 63rd birthday: ▫️in 2022 - from 19 to 29 years; 2023 - from 20 to 30 years; In 2024 - from 21 to 31 years old; In 2025 - from 22 to 32 years old; In 2026 - from 23 to 33 years old; ▫️in 2027 - from 24 to 34 years old. And starting next year, you must have at least 30 years of experience. Those who do not have enough experience will have to work until the age of 63 (if they have 23 years of experience) and 65 (if they have 15 to 23 years of experience). The second news is that there will be no traditional increase of the minimum pension by the inflation rate this year. send news @novosti_kieva_bot 👉SUBSCRIBE",0.006,0.974,0.019,0.5267,n/a,n/a

According to Mr. Auštrevičius, Belarusians who want to come to Lithuania should be subject to the same restrictions as the residents of Muscovy, that is, exceptions should be made only for those fleeing persecution, political activists or opposition. According to P. Auštrevičius, Lithuanians who go to Belarus are also a delicate problem. ""Do you agree that the money you spent in Belarus will be used against Ukraine and, possibly, against Lithuania?"" - Austrevicius asked. 🧐It is nice to see that representatives of other countries also identify White Russia with Muscovy and put these two undercountries on the same level. It is worth emphasizing that White Muscovy is the same aggressor and participant in the Russian-Ukrainian war, participates in the murder of Ukrainians and must bear full responsibility for what it has done.",0.071,0.849,0.08,-0.4098,n/a,n/a

In the first, they simply put some mirrors on the ground near the penguins and watched as random penguins looked into them. The second involved building a cardboard pen around the penguins, which directed them to the mirrors. During the third, scientists placed small stickers in the shape of penguins on the mirrors. And during the last test, the researchers put bibs on the penguins and put them in front of the mirror. Scientists did not find the answer in the first experiment, which was actually a discovery: many animals do not pass such a test when they believe that the creature they see in the mirror is something else, and react accordingly. In the second experiment, the penguins moved in a way that suggested they were exploring themselves. The penguins were also worried looking at the mirrors with stickers and actively tried to remove them.

Most likely they came to Ukraine with the help of a 3rd country, which bought them for us. 2) Domestic projectiles from UOP (3-5 media). The shell index (OF-25T) differs from the classic Soviet OF-25 shell, presumably because of a different manufacturing process-the shells are assembled from several milled parts. The explosive material is also different, using less powerful TNT instead of A-IX-2.
