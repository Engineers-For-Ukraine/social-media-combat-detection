Heavy fighting is taking place on the borderline Svatove-Kreminna and in the direction of Lysychansk. The most difficult situation remains in the area of Soledar-Bakhmut-Mayorsk. There the enemy is actually trying to advance over their dead bodies, but the units of the Defense Forces are holding back the enemy offensive at the cost of extraordinary efforts. In the Donetsk sector we managed to hold positions around Avdiivka and continue counter-offensive actions. We are reliably holding the defensive lines in the Zaporizhzhia sector and are making efforts to protect Kherson, first of all civilians and critical infrastructure of the city, from enemy shelling. The situation on the border with the Republic of Belarus is fully controlled. From December 31 to this morning, the enemy launched 14 cruise missile strikes and used 94 Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.

Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: \u25aa\ufe0fTo do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension.

For retirement at the age of 60: \u25ab\ufe0f in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2028 - from 35 years old.

Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: \u25aa\ufe0fTo do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension. The Pension Fund also told how to check the seniority: In your personal account on the left, select the section \"My insurance record\", where you can view information about your insurance record and paid contributions. For retirement at the age of 60: \u25ab\ufe0f in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2028 - from 35 years old. If you have not met this requirement, there is a chance to retire at the age of 63. To do this, you need to earn at least (depending on when you turn 63) by your 63rd birthday: \u25ab\ufe0fin 2022 - from 19 to 29 years; 2023 - from 20 to 30 years; In 2024 - from 21 to 31 years old; In 2025 - from 22 to 32 years old; In 2026 - from 23 to 33 years old; \u25ab\ufe0fin 2027 - from 24 to 34 years old.

And during the last test, the researchers put bibs on the penguins and put them in front of the mirror. Scientists did not find the answer in the first experiment, which was actually a discovery: many animals do not pass such a test when they believe that the creature they see in the mirror is something else, and react accordingly. In the second experiment, the penguins moved in a way that suggested they were exploring themselves. The penguins were also worried looking at the mirrors with stickers and actively tried to remove them.

Prices are likely to remain at the current level for the next six months. However, the situation will be influenced by the news from the front. This was told by the President of the Association of Realtors of Ukraine Yuriy Pita. According to him, there is a demand for apartments in the capital, but many people are still in no hurry to buy real estate, as the risks due to the war still remain. \"We will rely on the trends of the last few months - November-December - because the market has basically stabilized. There are no significant shifts in the direction of increase or decrease in value. In 2022, prices fell by about 15-20%, this is since the beginning of the war. They are not continuing their fall, so prices will be at this level. They have fallen to a certain level and will remain so. But, again, much will depend on the situation in the country as a whole,\" the expert explained. Pita added: if there are successes on the front, then the real estate market will also react quite actively. In addition, compensation to Ukrainians who lost their homes will have a positive impact on the situation. \"We hope that housing compensation programs will be launched for those who have lost their homes. This will also affect the market. There will be, perhaps, some monetary compensation or square meters. And the apartments on the market will be searched for somewhere, bought, transferred to those who suffered. So, such trends will be at least six months, and then we will see what will happen next.
