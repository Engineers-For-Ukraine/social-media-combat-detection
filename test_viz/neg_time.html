According to him, the successes of the Ukrainian army should not create a perhaps misleading impression of Kyiv's quick victory. He stressed that Ukraine is in dire need of the West's military support, as Russia has replenished the ranks of the military and is preparing to continue the war. \"If we want the peace treaty to enshrine the provision that Ukraine has won as a sovereign, independent, democratic European state, we must provide Ukraine with support. Including military support, because this is the only way to convince Russia to come to the negotiating table and recognize Ukraine as a sovereign, independent European state,\" Stoltenberg said. @babel", "negativity": 0.085, "neutrality": 0.755, "positivity": 0.16, "compound": 0.8819, "city": null, "oblast": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 46, "datetime": "04:45 PM, 01 Jan 2023", "message": null, "negativity": 0.0, "neutrality": 0.0, "positivity": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "city": null, "oblast": null}, {"Unnamed: 0": 47, "datetime": "04:45 PM, 01 Jan 2023", "message": "\u26a1\ufe0fA Russian BMP and crew destroyed in Luhansk Region For \"New Year's salute,\" the border guards involved artillerymen from one of the mechanized brigades. \"Bekha\" destroyed together with the crew \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc", "negativity": 0.181, "neutrality": 0.819, "positivity": 0.0, "compound": -0.7506, "city": "Luhansk", "oblast": "Luhansk"}, {"Unnamed: 0": 48, "datetime": "04:45 PM, 01 Jan 2023", "message": "\ud83d\ude21The occupants of Luhansk Region have intensified forced passportization It is now possible to travel outside the region only with a Russian passport or \"LDNR passports\".

Every working person can already calculate their retirement age: \u25aa\ufe0fTo do this, as noted in the Pension Fund, you need to check your insurance record in the Pension Portal. Then calculate how much more experience you can earn before the age of 60. If you have enough experience, you can count on a pension.

For retirement at the age of 60: \u25ab\ufe0f in 2023 - from 30 years; in 2024 - from the age of 31; in 2025 - from the age of 32; 2026 - from the age of 33; 2027 - from the age of 34; \u25ab\ufe0f in 2028 - from 35 years old.
